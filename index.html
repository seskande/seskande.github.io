                <li>Welcome to the Bridgers! </li>
                <li>You are now a citizen of Dauphine Island. Each week you will be presented with an issue that is challenging the island community. </li>
                <li>You will receive different information on the issue through the phone and newspaper on your home page. </li>
                <li>The calendar on the upper right corner will indicate the day of the week. At the end of the week you will be invited to a community gathering with other islanders. </li>
                <li>During the community gatherings, you will be asked to collectively make a decision in response to the current issue, using the information that you have gathered. Your decisions will impact the needs of you and the island community at large. </li>
                <li>Make sure to critically examine the information that you are offered and discuss with your fellow citizens to sustain life on Dauphine Island as long and as well as possible. </li>
                <li>Good Luck!</li>
