        <h1>Welcome to the North Side!</h1>
        <h4>Dauphine Island is on the brink of eruption. Not only is Mt. Sintra- an active volcano on the isle’s south side- steaming for the first time in hundreds of years, but residents are starkly divided on what to do about it. Those who live on the south side want to flee their now dangerous neighborhood, but north siders are hesitant to let them in, fearing how the wave of new migrants might change their community. Fights are breaking out across the island, as Mt. Sintra continues to boil. North and south siders alike are coming together in a community meeting to discuss the chaos engulfing their isle. </h4>
        <h3>Can you bridge the divide in Dauphine Island? </h3>
        <h4>You own a world-famous candy factory, Dauphine’s Delights, on the north side of the island. While you live in a thirty-one room mansion on the north side of the island, most of your staff dwells on the south side. You deeply love your community on the north side, but also value your employees. </h4>
