            <h2>Why the North Side is Saying ‘no' to southern refugees</h2>

            <h4>The northside wants to halt admission of all new refugees, saying the needs of northsiders must be prioritised over others. </h4>
            <h4>
                In the wake of the news that Dauphine Island’s Mt. Sintra, an active volcano on the isle’s south side, has been showing signs of steaming for the first time in over 250 years, the issue of relocating the citizens on the south side has become a steamy topic of debate for the island’s natives. Recent opinion polls and interviews have shown that most northsiders do not want or are apprehensive about welcoming southern refugees who are seeking shelter to their side.

            </h4>
            <h4>
                "I am putting my community first," Sam, a northern teacher, said earlier this month. "We have challenges in the north side that must be addressed. You see the homeless here and then see refugees getting benefits, so I understand why some people think that's not fair," she said. 
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Some voiced their concerns about safety. "I would love it if there was an open door for refugees, but I also need to think about safety," says Jolin, one of the island’s most successful business owners. " Ruya, a restaurant manager on the north side, put it more bluntly, “If we get these immigrants to the north side, I know what kind of headlines I’ll be seeing soon on Northside Daily. Terror will become part of our lives. I need to protect my community and say no to this nonsense!”

            </h4>
            <h4>
                The island’s human rights organization, The Compass, has named the unwillingness of northsiders to accept southern citizens who are facing a grave danger, a humanitarian crisis. Widespread criticism from the east side’s citizens of the northsiders inaction has intensified, especially regarding opinions that north siders in need - especially the homeless -should be prioritised over refugees. However, the north siders opinions remain the same.
